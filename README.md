The assignment 1 repository for Network Science course.

Q1.py is the python code for question 1

Q3.py is the python code for question 3 to generate AB model networks

ABbonus.py is the python code for the bonus modified AB model

models generated by the AB model (Q3.py)

protein.edgelistAB.txt
powergrid.edgelistAB.txt

model generated by the modified AB model (ABbonus.py)

protein.edgelistABtweek.txt

# How to run it

Put all network edgelist.txt files into a subfolder named "networks"

For Q1.py

$ python Q1.py --file ****.edgelist.txt --directed 0

directed = 0 means the network is undirected, directed = 1 means the network is directed

For Q3.py

$ python Q3.py --file "name" --size x --edges y

"name" is the filename for the generated network, a edgelist.txt file will be generated. use size x and edges y to specify the number of nodes and edges

Same for ABbonus.py

$ python ABbonus.py --file "name" --size x --edges y
